It seems as if the C++/octave code runs a bit over 10 times faster than this.
I would like to see where the slowdown is.

2 neurons, variable poisson into stochastic rate 
spiking rate modification
time 1e4

In [3]:%timeit optim.optim()
                     10 loops, best of 3: 328 ms per loop


w/o save_spikes:

                	10 loops, best of 3: 281 ms per loop

w/o saving at all:

                    10 loops, best of 3: 272 ms per loop


so saving it not part of the problem

back with all, just to recheck original numbers:

                    10 loops, best of 3: 331 ms per loop

w/o neuron update:
                  	10 loops, best of 3: 167 ms per loop

w/o connection saturate too
                    10 loops, best of 3: 138 ms per loop

w/o connection update too,
                    10 loops, best of 3: 49.6 ms per loop

w/o save spikes too
                   100 loops, best of 3: 10.6 ms per loop


just getting rid of connection update:

                   10 loops, best of 3: 239 ms per loop


replacing c_list[i].saturate() with saturate(c_list[i]):

before:
       				10 loops, best of 3: 333 ms per loop

after:
      			    10 loops, best of 3: 317 ms per loop
                       (5% speedup)
                       
                       
replacing c_list[i].update(t) (in this case) with
            Spiking_Rate_update(c_list[i],t)
                     10 loops, best of 3: 319 ms per loop
                      (about 5% speedup)

with

            Spiking_Rate_cupdate(c_list[i],t)
                     10 loops, best of 3: 309 ms per loop
                     (maybe another 5%)
                     
replacing with struct

               10 loops, best of 3: 242 ms per loop
          
wow!  almost like it's not there!  seems like most of the time is spent on
Python API calls in the update methods

Now I have it down to:


In [2]:%timeit optim.optim()
10 loops, best of 3: 55.4 ms per loop


compare to soctagon:
