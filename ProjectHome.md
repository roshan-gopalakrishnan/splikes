This project aims at providing a simple-to-use neural simulator at a medium-level of complexity.  This package is lower-level than rate-based models (Hebbian, BCM, ICA, ...) but higher level than packages like Neuron and Genesis.

This project is supported in part by NSF CRCNS Grant "The Cellular Basis of Receptive Field Plasticity in Visual Cortex: An Integrative, Experimental and Theoretical Approach" #IIS-0515285
